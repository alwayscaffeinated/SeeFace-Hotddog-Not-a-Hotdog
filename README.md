# SeeFood-Hotddog-Not-a-Hotdog
Inspired by the popular Seefood app built using Machine Learning in HBO's series 'Silicon Valley' that classifies an image 
as a 'Hotdog' or 'Not a Hotdog', I've built my first Neural Network from scratch that would do the same. 
I've implemented the Neural Network using Logistc regression (from scratch again).
