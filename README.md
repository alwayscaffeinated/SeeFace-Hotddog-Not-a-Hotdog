# SeeFood-Hotddog-Not-a-Hotdog
Inspired by the popular Seefood app built using Machine Learning in HBO's series 'Silicon Valley' that classifies an image 
as a 'Hotdog' or 'Not a Hotdog', I've implemented Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset to classify images as a hotdog or not a hotdog.
